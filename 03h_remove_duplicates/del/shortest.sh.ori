This script reads input from  stdin  and processes each line to keep the file in each group with the shortest path.
It uses the  cut  command to extract the path from each line and compares the length of each path to find the shortest one in each group.
Finally, it prints the shortest path for each group. You can use this script with the  fdupes  command like this:
fdupes -r /path/to/directory | ./shortest_path.sh
This will output the shortest path for each group of duplicate files found by  fdupes .
